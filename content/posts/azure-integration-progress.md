## Azure Integration Motivation

More recently I've been looking into azure integration and have been wanting to advance in the field. I enjoy all the real world uses of these products and have been taking on whatever becomes available at work. I'm looking forward to getting more hands on experience.

So far I've found that I really enjoy working with function apps and bicep templates, and less so with cosmos db but I do understand its place. 

I also quite like all the telemetry in azure as well as how easy it is to get started with developing your app to make use of the various services.

I have taken my AZ-204 and it helped pinpoint areas in which I need to improve, there are just so many Azure services that it's hard to keep track!

## Next steps

My plan is to now take the AZ-900 exam to prove I have the fundamentals down, and continue developing my knowledge in a private and proffessional setting.
