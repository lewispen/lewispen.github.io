## Integrate 2023

I recently had the pleasure of going to Integrate 2023, a 3-day event with lot's of great speakers in the Microsoft Integration space. I learnt a lot about Azure Integration Services that will help me with my long-term development. But I also wanted to keep track of and share some of my short term goals. 

This field is not my forte but the calibre of speaker at the conference has definitely inspired me to learn more!

Since then I've got the beginnings of a blog deployed via Azure, started an API security certification and earned a free Microsoft exam!

Before attending I didn't quite realise how much I had been needing a push to learn more about Azure Integration Services. Being surrounded by people who are so enthusiastic and talented in what they do really does wonders for your enthusiasm.

## Levelling up your online security knowledge

I had the pleasure of talking with Neno Crudele at Integrate, his talk felt like he was giving everyone a dressing down in regards to tightening our API security. Unveiling the dangers of how easily very bored people can exploit a company that does not keep track of what API's they have available to the public.

### API Security

Here's a [link](https://www.apisecuniversity.com/) to a free course by APISEC University with a certification in API Security that came highly recommended!
